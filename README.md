# archivebot
A bot that compiles images of how a website has changed throughout the years using Wayback Machine. Thanks to Richard Penman for writing some of the original code.

Usage is simple. "python archivebot.py m" or "python archivebot.py months" for screenshots by month, "y" or "years" for years, no options means a screenshot for every day.
You'll also need to put a file named "sitelist.txt" in the same place as the script and fill it with the URLs you want, one per line.
